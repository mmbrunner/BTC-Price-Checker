# BTC-Price-Checker

Here you will find the outline of the BTC Price Checker application

I designed this application as a tech challenge from a friend to improve my understanding and abilities in React, Node, Express, and MySQL

## The goal of the application is to:
  
    Launch a server 
    Connect to a MySQL database
    Retrieve 10 most recent entries and display them
    Retrieve current price and post it to the database
    Retrieve and post current price automatically every hour between 6am-6pm
    
## Testing if:

    Server launches and connect to MySQL
    App connects to Server
    App able to GET 10 most recent price checks
    App able to GET and POST new price check
    Schedule node cron able to GET and POST new price checks; every hour between 6am-6pm
